Local attraction
	Others of same - short range, semi-strong
Remote attraction
	Desired goal - long range, fairly week
Repulsions
	Threats - variable
	Too close - very short range, very strong
	Impassible - very short range, infinite

Each object sums up vector of weights to derive an impulse
Impulse causes acceleration until ojbect is at impulse velocity
Iterative resolution - object cannot be moved to an impassible space

Obects have size, mass, max velocity, max acceleration, max turn rate.
